# Body  Performance Class Predictor

## Overview

The **Body Class Predictor** is a machine learning application that predicts body classification based on various physiological metrics. Using advanced predictive modeling, the app analyzes input data and assigns a body class category.

## Features

- Predicts body classification based on physiological parameters
- Uses machine learning techniques for accurate predictions
- Easy-to-use interface for data input and result retrieval

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing body performance metrics and classification labels. The dataset includes features such as:

- Age
- Height
- Weight
- BMI
- Various fitness performance indicators

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas 
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- Jupyter Notebook (For model training and experimentation)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/body-class-predictor.git
   cd body-class-predictor
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

- Input physiological data into the model
- Receive predicted body classification
- Use results for fitness analysis or health insights
